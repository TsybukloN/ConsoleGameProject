# ConsoleGameProject

## Overview

This console-based game serves as the final project for the "Introduction to Programming" course. It is a simple game where the player controls a character (Witcher) and interacts with monsters on a grid-based map. The goal is to achieve a certain number of points by defeating monsters while managing the character's health.

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Compile and run the main.cpp file.

### Gameplay

The player controls the character using the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for movement, 'E' to hit monsters, and 'Q' to heal.
